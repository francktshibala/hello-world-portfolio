# Overview

As a software engineer, I created this Hello World program to establish a foundation in JavaScript programming while building good development practices from the start. This project serves as my entry point into modern web development and demonstrates my commitment to writing clean, well-documented code.

This is a personal and friendly "Hello World" program written in JavaScript that displays a greeting message along with my name and the current date. The program showcases basic JavaScript concepts including variables, date manipulation, string interpolation, and console output while maintaining a welcoming and interactive user experience.

My purpose for creating this software is to solidify my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals while establishing a professional development workflow. This project helps me practice version control with Git, technical documentation writing, and code organization - all essential skills for a software engineer.

## What the Program Does

This Hello World program:
- Displays a welcoming "Hello World!" message with emoji decorations
- Shows a personalized greeting with my name
- Displays the current date in a user-friendly format
- Includes encouraging messages about programming
- Demonstrates JavaScript fundamentals in a practical application

### Expected Output
```
ðŸŒŸ Hello World! ðŸŒŸ
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Franck! Hope you're having a wonderful day!
ðŸ“… Today is Thursday, July 3, 2025
ðŸ’» Welcome to my first JavaScript program for CSE 310!
âœ¨ Thanks for checking out my code! âœ¨
```

## How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your computer (download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))
- A terminal/command prompt

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd hello-world-portfolio
   ```

2. **Run the program**
   ```bash
   node hello.js
   ```

3. **Alternative: Run in browser**
   - Create an HTML file and include the script
   - Open in any web browser and check the console

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my primary development environment, which provided excellent JavaScript syntax highlighting, integrated terminal access, and Git integration. The built-in debugging tools and extensions made the development process smooth and efficient.

For version control, I utilized Git with GitHub for repository management, allowing me to track changes and maintain a professional development workflow from the beginning.

JavaScript was chosen as the programming language for this project because of its versatility and widespread adoption in modern web development. JavaScript offers excellent built-in capabilities for date handling, string manipulation, and console output, making it ideal for this type of program. Additionally, it can run in both browser and Node.js environments, providing flexibility for future enhancements.
